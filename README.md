# SRM-Academia-API---Python
This Repository is an unofficial API for Academia which is Online Portal developed by ZOHO for SRM University Katankulathur in order to show students their Attendence, Marks, TimeTable and other useful details. There was no official API of Academia when I wrote this piece of code but as of now WISOPT approached ZOHO and got their API up and running.
